# Hand Gesture-Controlled PowerPoint Presentation
This project allows you to control a PowerPoint presentation using hand gestures, leveraging computer vision and MediaPipe's Hand Tracking Module. The goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive way to interact with power point presentations using simple single-and two-hand gestures for actions like navigating between slides, drawing annotations, zooming in/out, and controlling pointer movements.

## Features supported:
- **Face Detection**: Detect and track the faceâ€™s position for gesture restrictions, based on the face's orientation, ensuring gestures are only recognized when the user is facing the camera.
- **Next/Previous Slide Control**: Navigate between slides using  a single hand gestures.
- **Pointer Mode**: Enable mouse pointer movement.
- **Drawing Mode**: Draw annotations directly onto the presentation slides.
- **Erase Annotations**: Clear back all annotations from the presentation.
- **Zoom Control**: Zoom in and out of slides using both hands.

## Key Note!!

- **Face-Centered Gesture Restriction**:
  Gestures such as navigation and annotation drawing are **only** recognized when the user's hands are above the **centerline of the face** (extracted through face tracking module). <u> This feature is important to prevents unintentional activations for gestures while normally presenting with hands</u>.
